# Python + numpy + pygame implementation of Game of Life

## About

This version uses Python 3 with numpy and pygame for visualization of the game board.

Thanks to the *awesome* GIL, this implementation does **NOT** use any sort of multithreading.

## Usage

```bash
# currently custom seed loading is not supported
./gol-py
```

## Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* numpy
* pygame
* scipy
